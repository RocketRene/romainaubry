As a certified DELF/DALF examiner-corrector for France Éducation international since 2021, I've evaluated hundreds of exam papers across all levels (A1-C2). Today, I'm sharing insider knowledge that can make a real difference in your exam performance.

## Understanding DELF and DALF

First, let's clarify what these exams are:

**DELF** (Diplôme d'Études en Langue Française):
- A1: Beginner
- A2: Elementary
- B1: Intermediate
- B2: Upper-intermediate

**DALF** (Diplôme Approfondi de Langue Française):
- C1: Advanced
- C2: Mastery

These are official French language certifications recognized internationally and valid for life.

## The Four Skills: What Examiners Look For

### 1. Compréhension Orale (Listening Comprehension)

**Common mistakes I see:**
- Overthinking answers
- Trying to understand every single word
- Not using the preparation time effectively

**Examiner tips:**
- Focus on key information, not every detail
- Read questions during preparation time
- Use context clues when you miss a word
- Don't leave blanks – make educated guesses

### 2. Compréhension Écrite (Reading Comprehension)

**What gets points:**
- Answering the question asked (not what you think it's asking)
- Managing time wisely across all questions
- Understanding question types (true/false, matching, open-ended)

**Pro strategy:**
- Start with questions you find easiest
- Underline key words in questions
- Don't spend too long on one difficult question

### 3. Production Écrite (Written Production)

**This is where I see the biggest score differences.**

**At B2 level, I look for:**
- Clear structure with introduction, development, conclusion
- Appropriate register (formal vs. informal)
- Varied vocabulary and sentence structures
- Logical connectors (donc, par conséquent, en revanche)
- Arguments supported by examples

**Common errors that cost points:**
- Writing too little (respect word count!)
- Poor time management (no time for conclusion)
- Mixing formal and informal registers
- Repetitive vocabulary

**My examiner secret:** A well-structured, coherent text with some grammar errors scores higher than a grammatically perfect but poorly organized text.

### 4. Production Orale (Oral Production)

**What nervous candidates don't realize:**
Examiners want you to succeed. We're not trying to trick you.

**For the monologue:**
- Take notes during preparation time
- Structure your presentation clearly
- Don't just read your notes
- Show you can develop ideas, not just list them

**For the interaction:**
- Listen to the examiner's questions
- Don't give one-word answers
- Ask for clarification if needed (it's not a penalty!)
- Show you can maintain a conversation naturally

## Level-Specific Advice

### B1: The "Independence" Level
**Focus on:**
- Expressing opinions with simple justifications
- Narrating events in past, present, and future
- Understanding main points of clear texts

**Don't worry about:**
- Perfect grammar
- Advanced vocabulary
- Complex sentence structures

### B2: The "Effective Argument" Level
**This is the most popular exam level. Show you can:**
- Develop arguments methodically
- Understand detailed texts
- Speak with spontaneity and fluency
- Use varied vocabulary and structures

**Key differentiator:** B2 requires development and nuance, not just stating opinions.

### C1: The "Autonomy" Level
**Examiners expect:**
- Sophisticated language use
- Complex idea expression
- Implicit meaning understanding
- Flexible, effective language use

## The Timeline: How to Prepare

### 3 Months Before
- Take a practice test to identify weaknesses
- Start regular exposure to French media
- Review exam format and requirements
- Begin targeted grammar review

### 1 Month Before
- Do full practice exams under timed conditions
- Focus on weak skills
- Build relevant vocabulary lists
- Practice speaking (even alone!)

### 1 Week Before
- Light review only – no cramming
- Do one final practice test
- Review common connectors and expressions
- Prepare topic vocabulary

### The Day Before
- Rest and light review
- Prepare materials (ID, confirmation, pens)
- Review exam timing and location
- Stay calm and confident

## Common Questions from Students

**"Can I pass without a teacher?"**
Possible, yes. Recommended, no. A good teacher (especially an examiner) knows exactly what evaluators look for.

**"What if I don't finish in time?"**
Time management is a skill. Practice with a timer. In the actual exam, if you're running out of time, prioritize completion over perfection.

**"How strict is the grading?"**
Fair. Examiners use detailed rubrics. We're evaluating against standards, not comparing students to each other.

**"What score do I need?"**
50/100 is passing. But aim higher – some universities or employers require 60-75/100.
